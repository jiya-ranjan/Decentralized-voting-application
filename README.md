# **Decentralized Voting Application**

## **Introduction**
This is a **Decentralized Voting Application** built using **ReactJS** for the frontend and **Solidity** for the backend smart contracts. The project aims to provide a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for conducting elections. By leveraging blockchain technology, the application ensures immutability and integrity of votes, making the process tamper-proof.

## **Features**
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for casting votes and checking election results.
- **Blockchain-Powered**: Votes are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based smart contracts handle the voting logic and ensure integrity.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Frontend built using ReactJS for seamless user experience and dynamic updates.
- **Decentralization**: No central authority; the system relies on blockchain for trust.
